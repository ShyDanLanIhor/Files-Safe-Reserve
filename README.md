The application GUI will be coded in C# .NET MAUI and will use either Razor pages (HTML, CSS and C#) or XAML markup. For developing GUI I either use the MVC or MVVM pattern. C++ functions will be called via .dll, .so or .dylib. Below are the possible features of the program.
1. Setting the intervals of automatic data backup (For example, every time the operating system starts).
2. Backup of HDD and SSD data in the form of a virtual safe (a separate local disk with closed access through the program).
3. Hiding or showing the safe.
4. Unlocking the safe through a password (perhaps through the phone).
5. Creating a key combination to quickly transfer data to the safe.
6. Backing up data on optical discs from a computer.
7. Backing up data on flash drives from a computer.
8. Backup data from smartphones to a computer (photos or videos).
9. Storage of backup combinations (sets from where to copy data to where).
10. Sorting of reserved files by reservation time.
11. Archiving or unarchiving the necessary collections of reserved data.
